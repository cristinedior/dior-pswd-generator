# BCS Week 3, Password Generator in JS

## Getting Started

This project involved generating a password, with chosen criteria via prompts on the page. I began the github/vscode connection establishment, once completed I moved onto editing my files. 

We were given source code via index.html, css and script.js files. We were tasked with adding correct variables and functiions using appropriate js methods.

From there assessed which direction I wanted to go to match the example portfolio given. I had to often refer to bcs/edx-chat, chatgpt, mdn, google, and my scheduled a tutoring session. The following webpages really helped me understand flex boxes and placement of elements. Plus, it really drilled in the different between inline and block elements.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Issues Created / Solutions

  1. Add original source code (index.html, css, js).
  2. Create README.md
  3. Test generating passwords on webpage to verify functions/prompts are working.
  5. Go through html and javascript files to check for redundancies or places where you can condense elements.
  6. Deployment.
